There are three types of edits that can be be performed on strings:
insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

# Example

- pale, ple -> true
- pales, pale -> true
- pale, bale -> true
- pale, bake -> false
