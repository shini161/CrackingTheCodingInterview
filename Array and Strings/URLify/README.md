Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with %20;
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end
to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implemented in Java, place use a character
array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

# Example

- **Input**: "Mr John Smith ", 13
- **Output**: "Mr%20%John%20%Smith"
