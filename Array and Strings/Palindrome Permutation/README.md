Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word of phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

# Example

- **Input**: Tact Coa
- **Output**: True (permutation: "taco cat", "atco cta", ecc.)

# Special Cases

- If the string contains only non-letter characters, it will still return that it is a palindrome.
